# ggplot explain:
# I used a line plot to visualize the S&P 500 index over time, as it effectively shows trends and 
# patterns in the stock market’s performance across years. This plot highlights periods of growth and decline, 
# making it ideal for understanding long-term economic changes and investor sentiment.

# To determine the appropriate statistical tests for your SP500 dataset
# ggplot2 is great for visualizing the results of statistical tests but doesn’t directly perform them.
# You can use ggplot2 to create scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and regression lines to visualize relationships or distributions, 
# and then supplement those visuals with the results of statistical tests (like correlation, or t-tests).
